.SH NAME
fritzident \- parental control for Fritz!Box
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fritzident
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B fritzident
daemon.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBfritzident\fP is a program that eneabeling the parental control
function of the AVM Fritz!Box.
It mimics the standard AVM Windows application that allows the Fritz!Box to
recognize individual users connecting to the internet.
.br 
This application is supposed to run under control of inetd.
.SH Internal working
At startup, fritzident sends out a prompt message, then waits for a
single command, and sends the response.
The prompt message is "AVM IDENT", and is required for the Fritz!Box to
recognize the agent.
.PP
Recognized commands:
.IP USERS
return a list of known users.
.IP "TCP ip:port"
return the name of the user for the specified local TCP port.
.IP "UDP ip:port"
idem, but for UDP ports.
.PP
The prompt, as well as all replies, are terminated by a CR & NL (ASC 13 + ASC
10).
Commands are recognized with either CR & NL or just NL line termination.
This allows fritzident to be tested interactively.
.SH OPTIONS

starting with two dashes (`-').
