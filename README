General Information
===================
Fritzident is supposed to run under control of inetd. It assumes that its stdin and stdout are already connected and immediately starts the communication.

The provided Makefile can be used to compile the program. Obviously, a the make utility, a C compiler and base C libraries need to be installed for this to work. Compilation has been tested on Ubuntu 13.04.

Installation
============
To install fritzident, copy the executable program to an appropriate location and add a line to /etc/inetd.conf to start it for incoming TCP connections on port 14013. E.g.

# /etc/inet.conf
14013	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/fritzident fritzindent


Internal working
================

At startup, fritzident sends out a prompt message, then waits for a single command, and sends the response.
The prompt message is "AVM IDENT", and is required for the Fritz!Box to recognize the agent.

Recognized commands:
	USERS		return a list of known users
	TCP ip:port	return the name of the user for the specified local TCP port
	UDP ip:port	idem, but for UDP ports

The prompt, as well as all replies, are terminated by a CR & NL (ASC 13 + ASC 10). Commands are recognized with either CR & NL or just NL line termination. This allows fritzident to be tested interactively.
